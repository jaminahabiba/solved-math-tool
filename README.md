As a software developer, you have received a new requirement from an Elementary School to develop a software to help kids to learn about whole number concepts, such as odd numbers, even numbers, find the greatest number and compute the average.

The Elementary School wants you to build a program that prompts the user to enter his/her name (Student name) and to enter a series of whole numbers.

Thus, your program will receive the following information:

• Student name

• Whole numbers entered at the keyboard.

Note: The Student will enter 99 to finish entries and exit the program.

The program then outputs the following information:

• Student name

• A count of how many numbers were entered

• A count of how many even numbers were entered

• A count of how many odd numbers were entered.

• The sum of the numbers entered.

• The average of the numbers entered.

• The sum of the odd numbers entered.

• The average of the odd numbers.

• The sum of the even numbers entered.

• The average of the even numbers entered.

• The largest odd number entered.

• The largest even number entered.
